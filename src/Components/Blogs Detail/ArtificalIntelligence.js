          Back in the 90s, artificial intelligence and machine learning were
          only algorithms and systems, but now they have real-time usage. From
          helping businesses automate their operations to helping them make
          data-driven decisions, AI has proven its worth in our ultra-modern
          world. Building smart machines and performing repetitive tasks are the
          basic concepts of AI. But are we using AI to its full potential? The
          answer is NO! Businesses have not used AI to its full extent.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#C8C8C8] text-[14px] lg:text-[18px] font-poppins">
          Thus, we have made a DIY platform called DFOS, which helps
          manufacturing hubs embrace the advantages of deep tech such as AI,
          IIOT, =RPA, and so forth. Today, we will primarily focus on artificial
          intelligence.

          What is Artificial Intelligence?
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#C8C8C8] text-[14px] lg:text-[18px] font-poppins">
          The thirst of humans to invent something new and more innovative has
          led to num technologies that can now perform human tasks, and
          Artificial intelligence, or AI, is one of them. AI is a branch of
          computer science involved in creating smart machines that can
          replicate human intelligence and perform repetitive tasks. In other
          words, AI is a technology that can make decisions which generally
          requires a certain level of human knowledge or expertise. Today, it
          can deal with the basic problems and issues of everyday life.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#C8C8C8] text-[14px] lg:text-[18px] font-poppins">
          AI has the capability of changing vision of the entire world. It is a
          wonderful technology for gathering information, analyzing data, and
          helping organizations take real-time decisions. So, now we have a
          brief understanding that what AI is. But do you know how AI works?
          Let’s peep into the answer.

        <p className="text-[#C8C8C8] text-[14px] lg:text-[18px] font-poppins">
          Understanding the workings of AI technology is a hard nut to crack but
          let us learn about it in simple terms.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#C8C8C8] text-[14px] lg:text-[18px] font-poppins">
          AI has intuitive processing algorithms that can learn the behavioral
          patterns of humans\machines and replicate them. Further, AI uses
          zillions of data sources to extract meaningful insights from them.
          This data can be manipulated to solve complex issues, use cases and
          answer generic questions about everyday lives.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#C8C8C8] text-[14px] lg:text-[18px] font-poppins">
          Here are the five basic steps of how AI works:
