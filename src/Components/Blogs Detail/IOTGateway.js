          What is an IoT Edge Gateway?
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#C8C8C8] text-[14px] lg:text-[18px] font-poppins">
          An IoT edge gateway is a device that serves as a bridge between the
          machines on a shop floor and the cloud. It acts as a communication
          hub, collecting data from sensors and devices and transmitting it to
          the cloud for analysis and storage. The edge gateway also enables the
          transmission of commands and instructions from the cloud to the
          devices, allowing for real-time control and automation.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#C8C8C8] text-[14px] lg:text-[18px] font-poppins">
          At the heart of any IoT ecosystem on a shop floor, the edge gateway
          plays a crucial role. It acts as a bridge, connecting machines and
          devices to the cloud and enabling seamless communication and data
          exchange. Edge gateways empower manufacturers with valuable insights
          into machine performance and production processes.
